        <div class="prose">
          <p>You open your music app after a hard day. You scroll past "Chill Hits" and "Sad Songs" and "Feel Good Friday" and none of it is right. Because you are not one mood from a dropdown menu. You are a specific person with a specific feeling at a specific moment, and the gap between that and a playlist called "Mood Booster" is enormous.</p>
          <p>You end up playing the same three albums again. Not because there is nothing new to find. Because nothing out there is even trying to understand you.</p>

            <h3>say whatever you feel.</h3>
            <p>Open Aria and talk to her like you would a friend. "I had a terrible day and I want to feel understood." "Restless but not anxious." "Something for cooking alone on a Sunday." There is no wrong way to say it, and you never have to pick from a list.</p>
          </div>

            <span class="step-number" aria-hidden="true">2</span>
            <h3>she finds the music.</h3>
            <p>Aria listens to what you said &mdash; and what you meant. She knows the difference between wanting music that matches your sadness and wanting music that lifts you out of it. Five songs, chosen for this moment, from real artists you can fall in love with.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step-card">
            <span class="step-number" aria-hidden="true">3</span>
            <h3>she remembers.</h3>
            <p>Every song you love, skip, or come back to teaches Aria something about you. Over time, she learns that your version of "energetic" is different from most people's. That you reach for shoegaze on rainy mornings. That "calm" means something new to you after midnight. She gets better because you are here.</p>

            <h3>your words, not their categories.</h3>
            <p>Aria understands natural language &mdash; the messy, specific way you actually feel. No mood grid. No dropdown. "Melancholic but I want to dance" is a real feeling, and she gets it.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="diff-card">
            <span class="diff-icon" aria-hidden="true">✦</span>
            <h3>she knows what you want the music to do.</h3>
            <p>"Play me something sad" and "I want to feel less alone" are different requests. Aria hears the difference &mdash; and finds music that responds to what you actually meant.</p>

            <span class="diff-icon" aria-hidden="true">✦</span>
            <h3>personal, not popular.</h3>
            <p>Aria never recommends something because it is trending. She learns your patterns &mdash; what works at 2pm, what works at 2am. Your taste is yours. She respects that.</p>
          </div>

            <h3>real songs by real artists.</h3>
            <p>When you are heartbroken, you need Jeff Buckley or Phoebe Bridgers, not generated soundscapes. Aria finds real music from the full Apple Music catalog &mdash; songs with weight, history, and someone's voice.</p>

          <p>Aria exists because one person needed her before anyone else did.</p>
          <p>No investors to satisfy. No engagement metrics to hit. No growth team deciding how often to interrupt you. One person making sure every song recommendation is worth your time.</p>
