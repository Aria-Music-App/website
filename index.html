        <div class="prose">
          <p>You open your music app after a hard day. You scroll past "Chill Hits" and "Sad Songs" and "Feel Good Friday" and none of it is right. Because you are not one mood from a dropdown menu. You are a specific person with a specific feeling at a specific moment, and the gap between that and a playlist called "Mood Booster" is enormous.</p>
          <p>You end up playing the same three albums again. Not because there is nothing new to find. Because nothing out there is even trying to understand you.</p>

            <h3>say whatever you feel.</h3>
            <p>Open Aria and talk to her like you would a friend. "I had a terrible day and I want to feel understood." "Restless but not anxious." "Something for cooking alone on a Sunday." There is no wrong way to say it, and you never have to pick from a list.</p>

            <h3>she finds the music.</h3>
            <p>Aria listens to what you said &mdash; and what you meant. She knows the difference between wanting music that matches your sadness and wanting music that lifts you out of it. Five songs, chosen for this moment, from real artists you can fall in love with.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step-card">
            <span class="step-number" aria-hidden="true">3</span>
            <h3>she remembers.</h3>
            <p>Every song you love, skip, or come back to teaches Aria something about you. Over time, she learns that your version of "energetic" is different from most people's. That you reach for shoegaze on rainy mornings. That "calm" means something new to you after midnight. She gets better because you are here.</p>

          <div class="diff-card">
            <h3>your words, not their categories.</h3>
            <p>Other music apps give you a grid of moods to tap. Happy. Sad. Focus. But feelings do not come in five flavors. Aria understands natural language &mdash; the messy, contradictory, specific way you actually describe how you feel. "Melancholic but I want to dance" is not a contradiction. It is a real feeling, and Aria gets it.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="diff-card">
            <h3>she knows what you want the music to do.</h3>
            <p>There is a difference between "play me something sad" and "I am sad and I want to feel less alone." One wants music that matches. The other wants music that holds you. Aria understands the intent behind your words &mdash; whether you want to sit in your feeling, shift it, or be surprised.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="diff-card">
            <h3>personal, not popular.</h3>
            <p>Aria will never recommend something because it is popular. She does not average your taste with millions of strangers. She learns you &mdash; your patterns, your edges, the songs that work for you at 2pm versus 2am. Your taste is yours. Aria respects that.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="diff-card">
            <h3>real songs by real artists.</h3>
            <p>When you are heartbroken, you need Jeff Buckley or Phoebe Bridgers or that one song only you remember. Not a generated soundscape. Not white noise. Aria finds music from the full Apple Music catalog &mdash; songs with weight, history, and someone's voice.</p>

          <p>Aria exists because one person needed her before anyone else did.</p>
          <p>No investors to satisfy. No engagement metrics to hit. No growth team deciding how often to interrupt you. One person making sure every song recommendation is worth your time.</p>
